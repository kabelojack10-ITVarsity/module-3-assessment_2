               <p>Matcha is still a leader in the health trend. It is commonly found in traditional Japanese mochi, as a filling, and as a base for cookies.As we mentioned earlier though, 2019 is the year of the cake, so serving a slice of matcha cake, with its striking green color, could be a great option for you. You'll be surprised at how popular it may prove to be.</p>
